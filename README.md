## About Me

Hi, I’m Sage. I’m a full-stack software engineer who builds and scales real-world systems across frontend, backend, and AI-enabled workflows. I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering, system design, and performance — turning complex requirements into reliable, maintainable applications that people actually use.

My background blends full-stack engineering with applied AI and technical SEO. I approach SEO not as marketing, but as a systems problem: site architecture, performance, structured data, and automation. This perspective has shaped how I build APIs, frontend interfaces, internal tools, and data pipelines where usability, reliability, and discoverability directly impact outcomes.

Across my work, I focus on clean engineering, thoughtful automation, and intelligent system design — often leveraging AI tools to accelerate development, testing, documentation, and system analysis.
